# aw-watcher-atom

This extension allows the open source tracking tool [ActivityWatch](http://activitywatch.net/) to keep track of the projects and coding languages you use in Atom.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NicoWeio/aw-watcher-atom).

## Features

Sends the following data to ActivityWatch:

-   current project name (i.e. the name of the first project folder)
-   coding language
-   current file name

## Requirements

To run this extension, you need to have a running ActivityWatch server.
You should be able to see your dashboard at [localhost:5600](http://localhost:5600/).
If you don't use ActivityWatch already,

Upon installation, it will automatically connect to your local ActivityWatch Server and continuously report your usage data to it.
If you're viewing this from within Atom â€“ great!
Just click <kbd>Install</kbd>.
